    "# Working with Larger Datasets with a Scalable Solution!\n",
    "Consider the size of the datasets you have worked with at Uni. Probably a few hundred megabytes or a couple gigabytes. Whilst `pandas` and `Excel` do have their use cases, it is not feasible to use them when you work with larger datasets over several gigabytes. You have been working with moderately sized data. In this subject, you will be working with larger datasets (not quite big data).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. 20k rows would be hard for Excel, but easy for `pandas`.\n",
    "2. A few million records would be doable for `pandas` depending on RAM (let's say 16GB or 32GB to be generous).\n",
    "3. Now, consider 100 million rows over several gigabytes. `pandas` **is not your solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` works in-memory. That is, you are limited by RAM which can be hard to come across for the average person. Even with 32GB or 64GB memory, it is best to use Apache Spark, which is designed to work with large datasets.\n",

    "CSV:\n",
    "- `csv` are tabular data formats read in line by line using a `,` delimiter.\n",
    "- That is, these are stored by rows.\n",
    "- They consume a lot of disk space and are one of the **most inefficient** ways of storing data.\n",
    "- However, they are widely used and easy to use for smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet:\n",
    "- `parquet` on the other hand is stored in columns and (ELI5) are very efficient with data formats.\n",
    "- For example, a single row in a `csv` can contain several different data types. \n",
    "- `parquet` just have the single data type per column, allowing compression algorithms to be applied to reduce disk space and read efficiency.\n",
    "- For alternatives to `csv` for row based data formats, you can take a look at `avro`.\n",
